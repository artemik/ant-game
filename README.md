# Welcome to Ant Game
## Introduction
Ant Game is a simple game that teaches kids programming.
A game map consists of cells of different types (cubes, holes, occupied cells) and one Ant.
Kids control Ant by giving it a list of simple commands (move up, jump left, etc).
Each map has a problem to be solved (put all cubes in one line, for example).
Teachers create maps and problems, kids solve them.
Listings of Ant commands can be saved in a file and shared.
The software is written in Java, using JavaFX and other helper libraries.

Please note, that **Java 8 is required.**
